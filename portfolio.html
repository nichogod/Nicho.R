<h1> I had a great time making the game! The concept of our game was for the archur on the castle to shoot the little green 
goblins coming at him. If the goblins touched the castle then there would be a big Game Over banner on the screen.
Using while loops we were able to have the goblins come at the castle constantly till a goblin touched the castle. 
Creating this game was a great learning experience and I am very excited for future projects.<h1>

<h1> This was a very fun game to make and to play! The concept of this game was a multiplayer octopi bubble game.
The player controls one of two octopi either a yellow or blue one the player can move them horizontally and tries to shoot 
the arrows vertically toward the bubble. The players try to work together to try and beat the previous high score. If the bubble
touches you the leader board screen will appear and that means you lost.
